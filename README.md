# Postman for Webex Status APIs #

This repo gathers Postman collections for **[Webex Status APIs](https://developer.webex.com/docs/webex-status-api)**.

Currently the Webex Status APIs includes below various services - 
- Summary
- Status
- Components
- Incidents
    - Unresolved incidents
    - All incidents
- Scheduled maintenance
    - Upcoming scheduled maintenance
    - Active scheduled maintenance
    - All scheduled maintenance

If you're new to Postman, then you're only a step away from getting the full benefits of this collection.
You just need to go through the steps shared in the [import and configure](docs/ImportAndConfigure.md) document, and you should be all set.
We have also discussed a brief Postman introduction there as well as tested a sample Status API Request in Postman with a screenshot attached for ease of use.
